Building Personalized Learning for Developers

A personalized learning platform crafted for developers! 
I am assigned to design the server-side architecture for this learning platform and develop it using Node.js and MongoDB. 
I will create the server-side components for CodeCraftHub using Generative AI.

In this project, I'll leverage the power of Generative AI and a diverse array of technologies to transform my vision into a reality.
